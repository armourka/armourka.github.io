bootstrapped using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) (CRA) _template_ with configured **Redux**, **TypeScript**, **React Router**, **React Testing Library** and custom **ESlint** configuration.

Original Create React App README available [here](./README_CRA.md)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm start` - runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
- `npm test` - launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
- `npm build` - builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
- `npm lint` - lints project files according to eslint rules, see below. Typical use case: continuous integration environments, Travis, CircleCI, etc.
- `npm fix` - same as `yarn lint`, but also fixes errors, when possible. Typical use case: local development environment, git hooks.
